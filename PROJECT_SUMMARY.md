## Design Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Next.js Framework
**Decision**: Use Next.js for full-stack development  
**Rationale**:
- Single codebase for frontend and API
- Built-in API routes (no separate backend)
- Excellent deployment options (Vercel, etc.)
- Great developer experience
- Server-side rendering capabilities

### 2. Google Cloud Vision API for OCR
**Decision**: Use Google Cloud Vision API for enterprise-grade accuracy  
**Rationale**:
- Industry-leading accuracy (95-99% vs 70-85% with traditional OCR)
- Excellent handling of stylized fonts and curved text
- Fast processing (1-3 seconds vs 5-15 seconds)
- Supports 100+ languages
- Enterprise reliability and support
- Handles complex alcohol label designs

**Trade-offs**: Requires Google Cloud account and credentials, API costs after free tier (first 1,000 images/month free)

### 3. Server-Side OCR Processing
**Decision**: Process OCR on server, not client  
**Rationale**:
- More reliable for large images
- Doesn't consume client memory
- Consistent performance
- Better error handling
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 4. Flexible Matching Logic
**Decision**: Case-insensitive with tolerance  
**Rationale**:
- OCR isn't perfect (O vs 0, spacing issues)
- Real labels have formatting variations
- Balance strictness with usability
- Still catches actual mismatches
- ABV tolerance (±0.5%) for number recognition errors

### 5. No Database
**Decision**: Stateless application  
**Rationale**:
- Simpler architecture
- Faster to build and deploy
- No data privacy concerns
- Scales easily
- Meets project requirements
- Can be added later if needed

### 6. Tailwind CSS
**Decision**: Use Tailwind for styling  
**Rationale**:
- Rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Responsive utilities built-in
- Small bundle size
- Easy to customize
- Modern best practice

## Verification Logic Details

### Brand Name Matching
```javascript
// Case-insensitive substring search
"Old Tom Distillery" matches "OLD TOM DISTILLERY" ✓
"Old Tom" matches "Old Tom Distillery" ✓
"Different Brand" does not match "Old Tom" ✗
```

### ABV Extraction & Matching
```javascript
// Recognizes multiple formats:
"45% ABV" → 45
"45% alc/vol" → 45
"Alc 45% by Vol" → 45
"45%" → 45

// Allows ±0.5% tolerance:
Expected: 45%
Found: 45.0% → MATCH ✓
Found: 45.3% → MATCH ✓
Found: 46.0% → MISMATCH ✗
```

### Government Warning Detection
```javascript
// Searches for key phrases:
- "GOVERNMENT WARNING"
- "SURGEON GENERAL"

// At least one must be present
"GOVERNMENT WARNING: ..." → PASS ✓
"According to the Surgeon General..." → PASS ✓
No warning text → FAIL ✗
```
